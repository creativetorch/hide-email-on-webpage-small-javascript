# hide-email-on-webpage-small-javascript

Hide an email address on your webpage from spam bots, crawlers, and website scrapers with a small javascript.


Change "updateuser" (1 reference) and "updatehost.com" (in 2 places) for your desired user and email-domain address.
The script will add "@" and put everything together. 


var userid = "updateuser";

var hostid = "updatehost.com";

...remaining code removed for security reasons; see file...

Do not rename 'userid' or 'hostid'

<noscript> [Javascript needs to be enabled to view the updatehost.com email] </noscript>
